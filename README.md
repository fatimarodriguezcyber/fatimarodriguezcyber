<p> Hey there ! I'm Fatima A. Rodriguez, I am a student at Arizona State University pursuing a degree in Full-Stack Web Development! During my studies I fell in love with the coding process and enjoyed problem solving, I ran into cybersecurity and fell inlove even more especially as I am able to integrate my knowledge of web development into this fulfilling career. I am now an aspiring cybersecurity analyst looking to break into this field of great opportunity. I hope to showcase my determination and practical skills on my Github to further elevate my mastery of cybersecurity and web development. </p>
